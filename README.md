Additional required info for the ICSR 23 paper
Within this repository, you will find the Confusion Matrices corresponding to the CNN classification present in our Simulation and realdata set, for gesture recognition

The following image explains the pipeline. Added for reading purposes if the image on th epaper is too pixelated in pdf.
